# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** built with **React.js**! 🎮 This project is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, enhanced with features like:

- Turn indicator
- Timer for each player
- Scoreboard to track wins
- Highlights for winning combinations
- Draw match detection

## Features 🚀

- **Winner Highlight**: The winning combination is highlighted after a player wins.
- **Scoreboard**: Keeps track of wins for each player.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile devices as well as desktop.
- **Draw Match Detection**: If all boxes are filled and no player wins, the game declares a draw.
